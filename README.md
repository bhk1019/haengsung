If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. This app is a personal project and a constant work in progress!

Haengsung uses the [Swe4r](https://github.com/aakara/swe4r) gem to assist with its computations of planetary positions. The Swe4r gem itself is based on the [Swiss Ephemeris](http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephprg.htm) library, so please consult its documentation for help with using the gem.
